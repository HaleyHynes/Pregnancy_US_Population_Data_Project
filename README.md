# Pregnancy_US_Population_Data_Project

I plan to analyze pregnancy and fertility data
from the United States to determine how many women
were pregnant in each state in a given year and
how that compares to the population data for women
in each state in a given year. If I have enough 
time, I will also analyze abortion data, teen 
pregnancy data, pregnancy complication data, 
poverty data, or GDP data and compare it to the 
total pregnancy and population data.

I plan to use a Jupyter Notebook for my project 
because I like how it lets you explain the data in
markdown. I will load in csv data (or xslx data, 
if needed) and use pandas and maybe numpy to 
create dataframes. I would like to analyze 
individual state date, but also group state data 
into regions of the country to compare them. I 
will use matplotlib or seaborn to create 
visualizations of the data to make the data 
comparisons easy to understand.
